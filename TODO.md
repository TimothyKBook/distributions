# TODO List

## For Upcoming Version (0.3)
* Beta-Binomial Distribution

Achieving the following wish list would probably bring this to 1.0:
## Future Releases
* A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file
* A code of conduct
* `.given()` method for certain classes for conditional distributions.
    - e.g. for `X`, `Y` Normal, `X.given(mu=Y)` would yield another Normal.
* A `.fit()` method on an "empty" distribution that would yield empirical parameters and moments (potentially with `MLE` and `MOM` options).
* Multivariate distributions
